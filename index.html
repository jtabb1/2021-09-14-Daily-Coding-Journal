    <p>
      Yesterday I did about everything that I stated that I would do 
    (coding-wise I did work on my MVP and attend the lecture), although 
    I could have made more progress in all but the simplest of 
    these tasks.

    <p>
      Today I intend to continue to work on my MVP and to work on my 
    non-Amazon job.  I hope to be finished with my MVP today.
